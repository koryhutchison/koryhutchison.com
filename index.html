                Coding isn't the only thing I enjoy in life, but it certainly is something I
                love to do! When I'm not working on my computer I love to watch football and basketball,
                exercise with my wife, and golf! With this website I hope to highlight some
                of the work I've done, as well as provide some tutorials on some of the things I've learned myself.
