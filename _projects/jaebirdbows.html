                <a href="https://www.jaebirdbows.com">Jae Bird Bows</a> is an eCommerce website that
                I built for my sister as one of my first side projects. I had recently learned Django,
                and I wanted to have something that would look good on my resume. I built an entire admin
                interface and checkout process all from scratch. It was an amazing learning experience.

                I used Django as my main framework, but I used an additional library called <a href="http://doconix.github.io/django-mako-plus/">Django Mako Plus</a>.
                That library helps simplify the routing and adds a stronger templating language to Django. I used PostgreSQL for the
                database and designed the whole thing myself. From storing product information, orders, and even a coupon system, this
                database was quite a challenge. In order to process payments, I leveraged Stripe which made the process very easy, and professional.
