                Mentorli is a website that allows mentees make meaningful connections
                with mentors to help them start their career. I made this website with
                a fellow student for our capstone project. I feel like this website can
                make a very large impact not only for mentees, but for mentors and companies
                as well.

                We used plain old Django as our web framework, but we decided to go with React on the front end. We went
                with React because my colleague was very familiar with it, and I also wanted to learn something new!
                To facilitate React, we used the Django REST framework to create an API for getting and posting data. This
                project gave me a tremendous amount of experience with React and also how to create an API.
