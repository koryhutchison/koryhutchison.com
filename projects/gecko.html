                Gecko is what I decided to call a budgeting website that I created for myself.
                When I built this, my wife and I had just recently married and I wanted to make something
                that would help us keep track of all of our accounts, be private, and very inexpensive. I also
                saw it as an opportunity to get more experience working with the full stack. So
                that's when Gecko was born!

            <p>
                At the time was very familar with Django and PostgreSQL so that's what I decided
                to build it with. I used a lot of raw JavaScript and implemented Vue.js on one of the
                pages. I was very new with Vue at the time, so it's not my best work. But it was a great
                way to get experience!
