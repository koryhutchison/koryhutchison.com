                Git Touch Bar is an <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a> application
                that attempts to make the Touch Bar a little more useful. The application runs
                in the tray, but allows the user to change branches, pull, push, commit, and even
                stash changes! Now there is a simple touch interface for Git!

                This is simple interface that shows up when the user clicks on the icon in the tray. It
                shows the user what repos they are tracking, and let's them choose the repo they want active
                in the Touch Bar. To add another repo, just click the folder icon in the top right corner
                and find the folder in the Finder. When the specific repo is active, that means all the actions
                performed in the Touch Bar will be performed on that repo. Lastly, if you want to quit
                the application, simply click the "X" in the top left corner.
