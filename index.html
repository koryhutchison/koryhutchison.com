                Coding isn't the only thing I enjoy in life, but it certainly is something I
                love to do! When I'm not working on my computer I love to watch football and basketball,
                exercise with my wife, and golf! With this website I hope to highlight some
                of the work I've done, as well as provide some tutorials on some of the things I've learned myself.

                I've worked on several projects using languages such as Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I've also used
                frameworks and libraries such as React, Django, and Electron. Check out some of my projects to see
                what I've done.

                Over my time developing applications, I've learned a thing or two that are difficult
                to find on the internet. So I've decided to write some tutorials to
                hopefully help someone that is going through the same problems I already went through.
