                Gecko is what I decided to call a budgeting website that I created for myself.
                When I built this, my wife and I had just recently married and I wanted to make something
                that would help us keep track of all of our accounts, be private, and very inexpensive. I also
                saw it as an opportunity to get more experience working with the full stack. So
                that's when Gecko was born!

                At the time was very familar with Django and PostgreSQL so that's what I decided
                to build it with. I used a lot of raw JavaScript and implemented Vue.js on one of the
                pages. I was very new with Vue at the time, so it's not my best work. But it was a great
                way to get experience!
